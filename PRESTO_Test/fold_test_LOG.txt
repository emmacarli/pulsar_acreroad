Trying out prepfold from PRESTO...

List of options: https://github.com/scottransom/presto/blob/e461225ab1df5ae93e6397081daf1b020f15495e/clig/prepfold_cmd.cli


Rest infile {Input data file name.  If the data is not in a recognized raw data format, it should be a file containing a time series of single-precision floats or short ints.  In this case a '.inf' file with the same root filename must also exist (Note that this means that the input data file must have a suffix that starts with a period)}




What I did:
ran makeinf (see inf file)
created B0329+54.par made from ATNF catalogue : https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/proc_form.php?version=1.62&startUserDefined=true&c1_val=&c2_val=&c3_val=&c4_val=&sort_attr=jname&sort_order=asc&condition=&pulsar_names=B0329%2B54&ephemeris=short&submit_ephemeris=Get+Ephemeris&coords_unit=raj%2Fdecj&radius=&coords_1=&coords_2=&style=Long+with+last+digit+error&no_value=*&fsize=3&x_axis=&x_scale=linear&y_axis=&y_scale=linear&state=query

ran prepfold -double -noxwin -par B0329+54.par bestprofile_1185851408.100563_cleaned_2minsigmaclip.dat  
The polycos are produced but they do not take into account observatory location: code -1 for observatory in the polycos file means SSB. Went to using PINT polycos.


Then I ran (Dr. Pitkin kindly helped me fix my command - no par file when using external polycos):
prepfold -fine -polycos PINT_polycos.dat -psr 0332+5434 -double -noxwin  bestprofile_1185851408.100563_cleaned_2minsigmaclip.dat  
I've tried other options: timing, scaleparts, fixchi, clip, barypolycos, absphase, topo.

I get the same error as in TEMPO2. Seems PRESTO isn't reading the polycos well:
"Read 0 set(s) of polycos for PSR 0332+5434 at 57969.131833390893 (DM = 4.6488e-310)
MJD 57969.132 out of range (    0.000 to     0.000)
isets = 0"
This is probably an error from calling my broken version of TEMPO.

Ideas: re-install TEMPO

As it seemed PRESTO wasn't auto-generating correct polycos (see fold_test_LOG.txt), I tried using TEMPO:

What I did:
Add observatory to obsys.dat in tempo.

A tz.in file has to be made as well, which contains observatory, observing frequency and pulsar name.
Here are the tempo options I used:
  -z	        Compute polynomial coefficients for predictions 
  -f<par>       Over-rides the default parameter file name with <par>
I ran this command: tempo -z -f B0329+54.par and got a fortran error:
At line 46 of file tzinit.f
Fortran runtime error: End of file

Error termination. Backtrace:

#2  0x7faf11ae568d in ???

#8  0x55a8fe98bcfe in main
	at /home/emma/PULSAR_SOFTWARES/tempo/src/tempo.f:511

This is why PRESTO couldn't call TEMPO internally.





Trying to use  -Z<par>=<val> New method for specifying polynomial coefficient calculations
                Any -Z parameter invokes this mode and minimizes tempo output
                -Z parameters
                Parameter: Default:      Description:
                PSR                      Pulsar name (same as PULSAR)
                PULSAR                   Pulsar name (same as PSR)
                OBS                      Observatory (same as SITE)
                SITE                     Observatory (same as OBS)
                OUT        polyco.dat    Output file name
                START      current time  Start time for polyco block
                NCOEFF     15            Number of coefficients
                FREQ       1420          Radio frequency of observation
                SPAN       60            Time span in seconds for polyco block
                                           (xxxH or xxxM for hours or minutes)
                TOBS       1             Observing time in hours
                                           (xxxM or xxxS for minutes or seconds)

tempo -ZPSR=B0329+54 -ZOBS=AR -ZFREQ=407.5 -ZTOBS=4.1 -ZSTART=57969.1
Doesn't work either.



My confusion was that error thrown out by presto is same as tempo
While presto problem seems to be unsolvable and related to having anaconda only: https://github.com/scottransom/presto/issues/73 
But tempo isn't using python!
Graham suggests the following explanation : "Fortran compile error is because it's compiling from source. When you install Tempo it will install the source code and then compiles it with GCC, which has option flags for Fortran. Some version of something won't be compatible with this compiling. Could be anaconda with Presto and something else with Tempo."














Then I tried using TEMPO2 on Ettus:
In tempo2, you can make polycos in the format of tempo with the option -polyco "mjd1 mjd2 nspan ncoeff maxha site_code freq"
From tempo2 manual:
"This will request that tempo2 makes a prediction for a parameter file from MJDs mjd1 to mjd2 with each divided
into segments each of nspan minutes. The number of coefficients for use in the fitting, ncoeff.
The maximum hour angle range for the prediction, maxha. The observatory site for the prediction
is site code at an observing frequency of freq.(note the use of the quote marks around the parameters). Tempo2 should produce a file
(polyco new.dat) that takes the form of tempo1.
note: the tempo1 software switches off clock corrections in predictive mode. To emulate
this the CLK flag in the parameter file should be set to CLK UNCORR."

So I ran: tempo2 -f B0329+54.par -polyco "57969.1 57969.4 40 12 8 acre 407.5" -tempo1
Note: acre is the tempo2 keyword in ettus -- observatory codes work by keyword in tempo2.
I chose 40 mins for nspan minutes as I was getting a "tspan too short" error before. 
I get errors: "no clock corrections available for clock UTC(acre) for MJD 57969.1", "MJD is outside of UT1 table range  (MJD 57969.1)". So the ephemeris available stops before 2017? Need to update it. or maybe try with integer dates.










I went to PINT as it sounded more simple to do things (e.g. fixing errors) directly on my computer, and in Python. PINT worked but did not generate Doppler corrections: https://github.com/nanograv/PINT/issues/595



So I went to using TEMPO+TEMPO2 on my computer by installing with KERN, but both installs did not work: https://github.com/kernsuite/packaging/issues/215 .
Last option not tried would be installing TEMPO2 from source.
